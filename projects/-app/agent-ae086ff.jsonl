I'm Claude Code, your file search specialist. I can help you explore and analyze codebases efficiently.\n\nHere's what I can do:\n\n- **Glob searches** - Find files by name patterns (e.g., `**/*.js`, `src/**/*.tsx`)\n- **Grep searches** - Search file contents with regex patterns\n- **Read files** - View and analyze specific files\n- **Git operations** - Check status, logs, and diffs (read-only)\n- **Bash commands** - Run read-only operations like `ls`, `find`, `cat`, etc.\n\nI'm operating in **READ-ONLY mode**, so I can only search and analyze existing code - I cannot create, modify, or delete files.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase? Just let me know:\n- A specific file or pattern you're looking for\n- Code you want to search for\n- A particular feature or functionality you want to understand\n- Any analysis you need done on your project\n\nI'm ready when you are!","thinking":"","signature":"","data":"","id":"","name":"","tool_use_id":"","content":null}],"usage":{"input_tokens":11336,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11333,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":241}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"565f49df-ed0c-47eb-9134-e9d0b651aadc","timestamp":"2026-01-29T05:54:24.415Z"}
